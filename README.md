# BulletinBoard

This is a full stack web application that allows users to post, archive, and share their ideas during a brainstorming session.

After signing up for an account, users can log into the service and click the create button to start creating posts. Within these posts, a user can share an image and add a caption as well. If the user who created the post would like to delete the post or edit it, they can only do so if they are the creator of the post.

If users are not logged in, they can simply view the current posts made on the platform. 

The inspiration for creating this project came from talking with one of my colleagues in university who studies Art History. They wanted a tool that could help them track their ideas and the pieces they wanted to discuss during the brainstorming session for an essay.
